After comparing the map with a telangana map with districts :

I chose k = 20 from the elbow plot, 

So, after analysing this k-cluster map, I found that 10 of the centroids were densly populated, the pincodes were all togather in a congested manner.
The points under the other 10 are scattered.

I have ploted some of the other k values as well,

When I plotted with 3 centroids (k=3):
  I found it looked like a cake being correctly divided into 3 parts. üòÖÔ∏è
  It was evenly divided, where each centroid had 1/3 rd of the points.
  
When I plotted with 4 centroids (k=4):
 After comparing the maps with k = 3 and k = 4, the northern most centroid in the map(k=3) did not change much in comparision to that of in map with  k = 4.
 the rest 2/3 rds of the map(k = 3) was divide into 3 parts.
 
 This tells us that the pincode concentration in the north of Telangana is high and there is high density of pincodes.
 
 When I plotted k = 5, The northern region which finally split into 2 regions. 
 
 From k = 6, it became harder to analyse this data.

So, I used the elbow method and came to the conclusion that k = 20, fit best as all other values after that didnot show any good change.

These are my inferences.
